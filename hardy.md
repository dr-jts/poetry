## The Convergence of the Twain - Thomas Hardy

(Lines on the loss of the "Titanic")

In a solitude of the sea  
Deep from human vanity,  
And the Pride of Life that planned her, stilly couches she.

Steel chambers, late the pyres  
Of her salamandrine fires,  
Cold currents thrid, and turn to rhythmic tidal lyres.

Over the mirrors meant  
To glass the opulent  
The sea-worm crawls — grotesque, slimed, dumb, indifferent.

Jewels in joy designed  
To ravish the sensuous mind  
Lie lightless, all their sparkles bleared and black and blind.

Dim moon-eyed fishes near  
Gaze at the gilded gear  
And query: "What does this vaingloriousness down here?" ...

Well: while was fashioning  
This creature of cleaving wing,  
The Immanent Will that stirs and urges everything

Prepared a sinister mate  
For her — so gaily great —  
A Shape of Ice, for the time far and dissociate.

And as the smart ship grew  
In stature, grace, and hue,  
In shadowy silent distance grew the Iceberg too.

 Alien they seemed to be;  
 No mortal eye could see  
The intimate welding of their later history,

Or sign that they were bent  
By paths coincident  
On being anon twin halves of one august event,

Till the Spinner of the Years  
Said "Now!" And each one hears,  
And consummation comes, and jars two hemispheres.

## The Darkling Thrush

I leant upon a coppice gate
      When Frost was spectre-grey,
And Winter's dregs made desolate
      The weakening eye of day.
The tangled bine-stems scored the sky
      Like strings of broken lyres,
And all mankind that haunted nigh
      Had sought their household fires.

The land's sharp features seemed to be
      The Century's corpse outleant,
His crypt the cloudy canopy,
      The wind his death-lament.
The ancient pulse of germ and birth
      Was shrunken hard and dry,
And every spirit upon earth
      Seemed fervourless as I.

At once a voice arose among
      The bleak twigs overhead
In a full-hearted evensong
      Of joy illimited;
An aged thrush, frail, gaunt, and small,
      In blast-beruffled plume,
Had chosen thus to fling his soul
      Upon the growing gloom.

So little cause for carolings
      Of such ecstatic sound
Was written on terrestrial things
      Afar or nigh around,
That I could think there trembled through
      His happy good-night air
Some blessed Hope, whereof he knew
      And I was unaware.
