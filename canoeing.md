## The Old Canoe - George Marsh

My seams gape wide as I'm tossed aside to rot on the lonely shore,  
And the leaves and mould like a shroud unfold, for the last of my days are o'er,  
But I float in my dreams on northern streams that never again I'll see,  
As I lie on the marge of the old portage with grief for company.  
When the sunset gilds the timbered hills that guard Temagami,  
And the moon beams play on far James Bay by the brink of the frozen sea,  
In phantom guise my spirit flies as the dream blades dip and swing,  
Where the waters flow from the long ago in the spell of the beckoning spring.  
Do the cow-moose call on the Montreal when the first frost bites the air,  
And the mists unfold from the red and gold that autumn ridges wear?  
Do the white falls roar as they did of yore on the Lady Evelyn,  
And the square-tail leap from the black pool deep where the pictured rocks begin?  
Yes, the fur fleet sings on Temiscaming as the ashen paddles bend,  
And the crews carouse at Rupert's House at the sullen winter's end,  
But my days are done where the lean wolves run, I'll ripple no more their path,  
Where the grey geese race 'cross the red moon's face from the white winds Artic wrath.  
Tho' the death-fraught way from the Saguenay to the storied Nipigon,  
Once knew me well, now a crumbling shell I watch as the years roll on,  
And in memory's haze I love the days forever gone from me,  
As I lie on the marge of the old portage with grief for company.  

## Rivers of Canada - Bliss Carman

O all the little rivers that run to Hudson's Bay,  
They call me and call me to follow them away.  

Missinaibi, Abitibi, Little Current--where they run  
Dancing and sparkling I see them in the sun.  

I hear the brawling rapid, the thunder of the fall,  
And when I think upon them I cannot stay at all.  

At the far end of the carry, where the wilderness begins,  
Set me down with my canoe-load--and forgiveness of my sins.  

O all the mighty rivers beneath the Polar Star,  
They call me and call me to follow them afar.  

Peace and Athabasca and Coppermine and Slave,  
And Yukon and Mackenzie--the highroads of the brave.  

Saskatchewan, Assiniboine, the Bow and the Qu'Appelle,  
And many a prairie river whose name is like a spell.  

They rumor through the twilight at the edge of the unknown,  
"There's a message waiting for you, and a kingdom all your own.  

"The wilderness shall feed you, her gleam shall be your guide.  
Come out from desolations, our path of hope is wide."  

O all the headlong rivers that hurry to the West,  
They call me and lure me with the joy of their unrest.  

Columbia and Fraser and Bear and Kootenay,  
I love their fearless reaches where winds untarnished play--  

The rush of glacial water across the pebbly bar  
To polished pools of azure where the hidden boulders are.  

Just there, with heaven smiling, any morning I would be,  
Where all the silver rivers go racing to the sea.  

O well remembered rivers that sing of long ago,  
Ajourneying through summer or dreaming under snow.  

Among their meadow islands through placid days they glide,  
And where the peaceful orchards are diked against the tide.  

Tobique and Madawaska and shining Gaspereaux,  
St. Croix and Nashwaak and St. John whose haunts I used to know.  

And all the pleasant rivers that seek the Fundy foam,  
They call me and call me to follow them home.  

## Night Hymns on Lake Nipigon - Duncan Campbell Scott

Here in the midnight, where the dark mainland and island  
Shadows mingle in shadow deeper, profounder,  
Sing we the hymns of the churches, while the dead water  
Whispers before us.  

Thunder is travelling slow on the path of the lightning;  
One after one the stars and the beaming planets  
Look serene in the lake from the edge of the storm-cloud,  
Then have they vanished.  

While our canoe, that floats dumb in the bursting thunder,  
Gathers her voice in the quiet and thrills and whispers,  
Presses her prow in the star-gleam, and all her ripple  
Lapses in blackness.  

Sing we the sacred ancient hymns of the churches,  
Chanted first in old-world nooks of the desert,  
While in the wild, pellucid Nipigon reaches  
Hunted the savage.  

Now have the ages met in the Northern midnight,  
And on the lonely, loon-haunted Nipigon reaches  
Rises the hymn of triumph and courage and comfort,  
Adeste Fideles.  

Tones that were fashioned when the faith brooded in darkness,  
Joined with sonorous vowels in the noble Latin,  
Now are married with the long-drawn Ojibwa,  
Uncouth and mournful.  

Soft with the silver drip of the regular paddles  
Falling in rhythm, timed with the liquid, plangent  
Sounds from the blades where the whirlpools break and are carried   
Down into darkness;  

Each long cadence, flying like a dove from her shelter  
Deep in the shadow, wheels for a throbbing moment,  
Poises in utterance, returning in circles of silver  
To nest in the silence.  

All wild nature stirs with the infinite, tender  
Plaint of a bygone age whose soul is eternal,  
Bound in the lonely phrases that thrill and falter  
Back into quiet.  

Back they falter as the deep storm overtakes them,  
Whelms them in splendid hollows of booming thunder,  
Wraps them in rain, that, sweeping, breaks and onrushes  
Ringing like cymbals.
